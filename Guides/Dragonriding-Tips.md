<h5>Пролет над Пепельными потоками</h5>

This race is located just south of Obsidian Throne, and has you go through a fiery loop through the Burning Ascent.  
<ul>
	<li><b>Обычная трасса:</b></li>
	<ul>
		<li>You do not get an immediate drop from the platform that you're at when you start the race. The fastest way to get out of it is to simply walk forward. Do not jump.</li>
		<li>The lava spouts that appear through the Burning Ascent portion of the race do stun you if you get hit by them, although you do not get close enough to them in the basic race.</li>
		<li>There are plenty of Vigor orbs by the Burning Ascent portion of the race, but you do not need to pick all of them. Some can be slightly out of the way/too close to lava spouts for comfort.</li>
		<li>Required time to Gold medal the race: <b>50 seconds</b>.</li>
	</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><b>Продвинутая трасса:</b></li>

		<li>There are MANY more lava spouts in the Advanced Race, and you CANNOT evade them with <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/ru/spell=378967"><img src="https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/ability_dragonriding_ohnahrasgusts01.jpg" width="11" height="11" valign="bottom" />Ветра Он'ары</a>, so do your best to dodge them!</li>

<h5>Полет Морозной Вспышки</h5>

This race is one of the races located by the Ruby Lifeshrine. It does a lap around the shrine and sends you through a quick trip in the Flashfrost Enclave before returning you to the top of the Lifeshrine.  
<ul>
	<li><b>Обычная трасса:</b></li>
	<ul>
		<li>The first ring of the race is a sharp drop from the starting line and not visible from the starting race camera, just turn downwards to see it.</li>
		<li>You can mostly spam <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/ru/spell=372608"><img src="https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/ability_dragonriding_forwardflap01.jpg" width="11" height="11" valign="bottom" />Рывок вперед</a> without too much issue, but you might slow down at a few points before you get to the Flashfrost Enclave. After entering the Enclave, you will have enough Wind Gales to carry you through the rest of the race.</li>
		<li>Required time to Gold medal the race: <b>63 seconds</b>.</li>
	</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><b>Продвинутая трасса:</b></li>
	<ul>
		<li>This is one of the harder races to Gold Medal on, as it doesn't offer you much opportunity to build momentum outside of the beginning drops and a number of Vigor orbs. Maintaining momentum is fundamental. As the finish line/ring is up in the air (unlike most races), you cannot cheese it with <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/ru/spell=375012"><img src="https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/inv_misc_head_dragon_bronze.jpg" width="11" height="11" valign="bottom" />Бронзовый портал</a>.</li>
		<li>Do not attempt to take shortcuts by passing through trees, many of them have Scalechargers hiding behind, giving your race a swift end. Building momentum at the Flashfrost cave and maintaining it all the way to the ascent portion of the race will be your best bet.</li>
		<li>In the Flashfrost cave, there is a Vigor orb right next to a Scalecharger - You are able to pick it up by passing below it without triggering the Scalecharger's stun.</li>
		<li>For the final ascent portion of the race, it's a good idea to spend Vigor on <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/ru/spell=372610"><img src="https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/ability_dragonriding_upwardflap01.jpg" width="11" height="11" valign="bottom" />Взлет вверх</a> instead of Surge Forward at the beginning, as it builds altitude and momentum. After the first 2 rings in the ascent portion, there are plenty of Vigor orbs to finish the race at full speed with Surge Forward.</li>
		<li>Required time to Gold medal the race: <b>61 seconds</b>.</li>

<h5>Круг у Рубинового святилища Жизни</h5>

This is one of the two races located by the Ruby Lifeshrine. This race loops around the shrine with many sharp turns.  
<ul>
	<li><b>Обычная трасса:</b></li>
	<ul>
		<li>You are able to spam <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/ru/spell=372608"><img src="https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/ability_dragonriding_forwardflap01.jpg" width="11" height="11" valign="bottom" />Рывок вперед</a> for most of the race, but be careful to not use it right as you take a sharp turn, as the added momentum will make the turn harder to do.</li>
		<li>You're slowly guided closer and closer to the ground as the race progresses, but near the end there will be a sharp ascent back to the top level of the Ruby Lifeshrine. Make sure you save some Vigor once you see the ascent portion of the race approaching.</li>
		<li>Required time to Gold medal the race: <b>53 seconds</b>.</li>
	</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><b>Продвинутая трасса:</b></li>
	<ul>
		<li>This race is noticeably different from its Basic course, with a drop right at the beginning and overall a lot of sharper turns.</li>
		<li>Unlike the Basic race, you need to watch your Vigor on the first portion of the race, but you should be able to get away with spamming <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/ru/spell=372608"><img src="https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/ability_dragonriding_forwardflap01.jpg" width="11" height="11" valign="bottom" />Рывок вперед</a> for the most part. There will be plenty of Vigor orbs to get you through the Ruby Lifeshrine ascent.</li>
		<li>There are two pain points in the race: The first one is a ring right next to a cliff before the ascent portion. It is safer to circumvent around the ring, but with the right momentum you are able to do a sharp turn through the inside portion of the cliff.</li>
		<li>The second pain point is right after the ascent portion of the race, where the next ring is not initially visible - It'll guide you through a final drop at the top level of the Ruby Lifeshrine before going up again to reach the finish line.</li>
		<li>Required time to Gold medal the race: <b>52 seconds</b>.</li>

<h5>Горки Уктулут</h5>

This race is located south of the Uktulut Backwater flight path, and goes through the neighboring area with lots of ascent portions.  
<ul>
	<li><b>Обычная трасса:</b></li>
	<ul>
		<li>You will want to be a bit conservative on your Vigor spending, as there are plenty of areas where you will need to go upwards and can easily lose momentum, and not a lot of Wind Gales to account for the ascents. Make sure to always hoard at least 1 Vigor when approaching an ascent.</li>
		<li>Required time to Gold medal the race: <b>45 seconds</b>.</li>
	</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><b>Продвинутая трасса:</b></li>
	<ul>
		<li>Although the Advanced race has sharper upward turns, it also has many more sharp downward moments and many more Vigor orbs when compared to the Basic race, so Vigor hoarding is unnecessary.</li>
		<li>The start of the race is slightly different from the Basic version, with a sharp downward ring right at the beginning.</li>
		<li>Although the race track is not very different from the Basic version, some rings are closer to things that can slow you down like the ground or tree branches, so be mindful when crossing through these.</li>

<h5>Трасса Дикого удела</h5>

This race is hidden within the Дикий удел and is referred to as a hidden gem, as it is a nice circuit through the Preserve with some scenic views.  
<ul>
	<li><b>Обычная трасса:</b></li>
	<ul>
		<li>The first ring of this race is located directly above your starter point - Use <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/ru/spell=372610"><img src="https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/ability_dragonriding_upwardflap01.jpg" width="11" height="11" valign="bottom" />Взлет вверх</a> to quickly get to it, then dip down the waterfall for the next ring.</li>

	</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><b>Продвинутая трасса:</b></li>
	<ul>
		<li>The first ring in the Advanced race is at a taller position than the Basic race ring, you might need to point your camera upward to try and get more momentum to reach the ring in one <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/ru/spell=372610"><img src="https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/ability_dragonriding_upwardflap01.jpg" width="11" height="11" valign="bottom" />Взлет вверх</a>.</li>
		<li>The turns in the Advanced course are tighter and some Vigor orbs are in hard-to-reach positions when flying at high speeds.</li>
		<li>One of the rings that threads a cliff needle has a lower cliff right in front of it that's not initially visible - To pass through the area without losing momentum, cross that ring through the upper half portion of it.</li>
		<li>There are some very tight turns that you might want to not immediately spam <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/ru/spell=372608"><img src="https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/ability_dragonriding_forwardflap01.jpg" width="11" height="11" valign="bottom" />Рывок вперед</a> so that you can make a tight turn - Using Surge Forward at the wrong time can make turns much more difficult due to the instant burst of speed from the ability.</li>

<ul>
	<li><b>Обычная трасса:</b></li>

<h5>Кольцо Крылатого Приюта</h5>

This race is located in the Wingrest Embassy, and it leads you around the Embassy area and some of the swamps to the east of it.  
<ul>
	<li><b>Обычная трасса:</b></li>
	<ul>
		<li>Some of the Wind Gales are slightly out of the way of the race track, but it is safe enough to go out of the way to get through them.</li>

</ul>

<ul>
	<li><b>Продвинутая трасса:</b></li>

		<li>It is not recommended to attempt the Advanced race without the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/ru/spell=378967"><img src="https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/ability_dragonriding_ohnahrasgusts01.jpg" width="11" height="11" valign="bottom" />Ветра Он'ары</a> talent, as there are many <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/ru/npc=190200/сфера-драконьей-молнии">Сфера драконьей молнии</a> right on top of rings, especially during the swamp roundabout portion of the race.</li>
		<li>You can still get away with mostly spamming <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/ru/spell=372608"><img src="https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/ability_dragonriding_forwardflap01.jpg" width="11" height="11" valign="bottom" />Рывок вперед</a>, but you will want to hold on to at least 1 Vigor at all times to evade Scalechargers, especially during the swamp portion of the race. After the ascent back into Wingrest Embassy, there won't be any more Scalechargers near rings, so you can spam Surge Forward without issue.</li>
		<li>There is a slight track change near the end of the Advanced race, in which you pass through a tower and go up a mountain for the next ring, then fly to the finish line from there. For this reason, it is recommended to use the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/ru/item=194549"><img src="https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/inv_companionpterrordaxdrake.jpg" width="11" height="11" valign="bottom" />Воздушный велоцидракон</a> for this race, due to the smaller hitbox (and lower chance of losing momentum by clipping the tower walls).</li>

<ul>
	<li><b>Обычная трасса:</b></li>
	<ul>
		<li>There is a Wind Gale at the beginning of the race that is stuck on the ground as of the time of writing. You can safely ignore it and instead use <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/ru/npc=197342/взлет-вверх">Взлет вверх</a> to get to the first ring.</li>
		<li>Most of the race is an upwards climb. Although there are plenty of Wind Gales to help you get through the ascent, you will want to safeguard some Vigor for <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/ru/spell=372608"><img src="https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/ability_dragonriding_forwardflap01.jpg" width="11" height="11" valign="bottom" />Рывок вперед</a> to maintain speed.</li>

<h5>Марукай Dash</h5>

This race is located by Марукай, and sends you around Марукай as you dash around to collect rings.  
<b>Race Tips</b>

		<li>This is a Dash race, which means that instead of racing through rings in a certain order, you have access to all 9 rings and need to pass through them at any order. To complete the race, you must pass through the 9 rings at the course, then fly back to the starting point.</li>
		<li>This is one of the best races to take advantage of <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/ru/spell=374990"><img src="https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/inv_misc_head_dragon_bronze.jpg" width="11" height="11" valign="bottom" />Бронзовый портал</a> \- Use it to set a timelock behind the Bronze Timekeeper (this is where the finish line will be), then start the race, collect all rings, then teleport back once you're done. This will save precious seconds that would you would need to spend flying to the finish line. This is not necessary for Gold medaling, though, but you will need some good pathing (as shown in the video below).</li>
		<li>For the Bronze Timelock strat, you can go through the Chieftain's House to get the 2 rings close to it at the beginning, you will want to use the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/ru/item=194549"><img src="https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/inv_companionpterrordaxdrake.jpg" width="11" height="11" valign="bottom" />Воздушный велоцидракон</a> for it though, as the mount has a smaller hitbox.</li>
		<li>As this is a Dash race, there is no Advanced course - Gold medal once and you're done!</li>

<h5>Маршрут над речными стремнинами</h5>

This race is located southeast of Тиракай and its a course based around the many rivers and waterfalls that permeate the Ohn'ahran Plains.  
<ul>
	<li><b>Обычная трасса:</b></li>
	<ul>
		<li>This entire course follows some of the rivers in the zone very closely, and as such, most rings are close to the ground. Be careful to not hit the ground and lose momentum, especially during the waterfall ascent!</li>
		<li>As the course is so close to the ground, ring visibility is hindered due to trees. Pay attention to sound cues to find the next ring if you can't immediately find it.</li>
		<li>There are not a lot of gale winds at the beginning of the race, so some Vigor preservation is necessary.</li>
		<li>Required time to Gold medal the race: <b>48 seconds</b>.</li>
	</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><b>Продвинутая трасса:</b></li>
	<ul>
		<li>Unlike the Basic races, there are plenty of Vigor orbs to guarantee maximum speed through the entire course. However, some restraint might be necessary, due to the course's lack of visibility and proximity to the ground.</li>
		<li>The two first Vigor orbs are slightly out of the way and can be hard to see if not familiar with the course - The first one is to the right of one ring you pass through, and the second one is hidden on the bottom of a waterfall next to a ring.</li>
		<li>By the time you cross the second river and start approaching the waterfall ascent, you will have plenty of Vigor, but be careful when using <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/ru/spell=376743"><img src="https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/inv_icon_wing08b.jpg" width="11" height="11" valign="bottom" />Рывок вперед</a> as you ascend the waterfall - The speed bump might be enough to hit the waterfall headfirst and stop you in your tracks.</li>

<h5>Кольцо в Роще солнечных бликов</h5>

This race is located northeast of Марукай, and it takes you on a trip around the Copse and Nelthazan Ruins.  
<ul>
	<li><b>Обычная трасса:</b></li>
	<ul>
		<li>The race course happens around an area with low visibility due to trees and the ruins themselves, so looking for rings is more difficult. Sound cues when passing rings may help locate the next one.</li>
		<li>One of the rounds around Nelthazan Ruins goes through a small tower, so using the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/ru/item=194549"><img src="https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/inv_companionpterrordaxdrake.jpg" width="11" height="11" valign="bottom" />Воздушный велоцидракон</a> may be preferred due to the smaller mount hitbox (and thus a lower chance of clipping the tower when passing through it).</li>
		<li>There is one ring near the end of the race that is right after a tree, going through the lower portion of the tree then quickly moving up again is the safest way of getting through the ring.</li>
		<li>Required time to Gold medal the race: <b>49 seconds</b>.</li>
	</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><b>Продвинутая трасса:</b></li>
	<ul>
		<li>Not a lot of differences from the Basic race besides some rings placed closer to the ground, make sure you fly high enough to avoid losing all momentum by hitting the ground!</li>
		<li>There are plenty of Vigor orbs through the track to finish the race by spamming <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/ru/spell=372608"><img src="https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/ability_dragonriding_forwardflap01.jpg" width="11" height="11" valign="bottom" />Рывок вперед</a>, but you might want to slow down at a few portions to allow for tighter curves which will gain more time in the long track.</li>

<h5>Авиатур над архивами</h5>

This race is located northeast of the Лазурный Архив, and it brings you on a scenic loop around Kauriq Gleamlet, Shiverweb Vale and the Лазурный Архив.  
<ul>
	<li><b>Обычная трасса:</b></li>
	<ul>
		<li>Although this is a long race, there are plenty of Wind Gales to carry you through the climbing portions of the race.</li>
		<li>There is one Wind Gale near the end of the race that can be very deceiving - At the angle you're flying, it seems you can pick it up, but it is too far from the near ring to be worth the detour.</li>
		<li>Required time to Gold medal the race: <b>91 seconds</b>.</li>
	</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><b>Продвинутая трасса:</b></li>
	<ul>
		<li>There are Ice Elementals summoning slowing orbs at several portions of the race, but these are easy to dodge - Just get out of their path or use <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/ru/spell=372608"><img src="https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/ability_dragonriding_forwardflap01.jpg" width="11" height="11" valign="bottom" />Рывок вперед</a> if you have the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/ru/spell=378967"><img src="https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/ability_dragonriding_ohnahrasgusts01.jpg" width="11" height="11" valign="bottom" />Ветра Он'ары</a> talent.</li>
		<li>Even though this is a long course, it is relatively easy to get Gold on if you have all Dragonriding talents as long as you don't get slowed.</li>

<h5>Лазурный слалом</h5>

This race is east of Берег трех водопадов and features a twisty course through the trees of the Span.  
<ul>
	<li><b>Обычная трасса:</b></li>
	<ul>
		<li>This course has many turns and not a lot of Wind Gales to get you through the race, so Vigor management is important. Save Vigor to use <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/ru/spell=376743"><img src="https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/inv_icon_wing08b.jpg" width="11" height="11" valign="bottom" />Рывок вперед</a> on long straight portions with no visible Wind Gales coming your way.</li>
		<li>There are many chances to hit trees by accident, so be careful with your turns!</li>
		<li>Required time to Gold medal the race: <b>58 seconds</b>.</li>
	</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><b>Продвинутая трасса:</b></li>
	<ul>
		<li>The course is significantly different in the Advanced version, with more turns through the trees.</li>
		<li>Unlike most races, this is a good race to start with <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/ru/spell=372610"><img src="https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/ability_dragonriding_upwardflap01.jpg" width="11" height="11" valign="bottom" />Взлет вверх</a> even though the first ring is below you - Most of the first portion of the race happens on a relatively plain level and the initial momentum from catapulting up in the air then diving down to the first ring will secure extra speed in the long run.</li>
		<li>Like the Basic race, there won't be a lot of VIgor orbs to keep your momentum up through the race, but there are a couple slightly out of the way of the rings that can be picked up to help you there. Managing your Vigor is important to not hit any trees or reach a point where you no longer benefit from <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/ru/spell=377234"><img src="https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/ability_dragonriding_thrilloftheskies01.jpg" width="11" height="11" valign="bottom" />Азарт небес</a>.</li>

		<li>There is one Wind Gale right at the beginning of the race above the first ring - You're able to reach that gale with <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/ru/spell=372610"><img src="https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/ability_dragonriding_upwardflap01.jpg" width="11" height="11" valign="bottom" />Взлет вверх</a> and then drop down to get the ring.

<h5>Подъем на Вактрос</h5>

		<li>This might be one of the only Dragonriding races in which the Advanced race is easier than the Basic race. The main problem of the Basic race is the lack of Wind Gales to sustain your speed through the race, but the Advanced race has a lot of Vigor Orbs to the point where the main issue of the race is to control your acceleration so you don't fumble tight turns! <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/ru/spell=372608"><img src="https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/ability_dragonriding_forwardflap01.jpg" width="11" height="11" valign="bottom" />Рывок вперед</a> on the long straight portions of the race and you should be fine to get a nice Gold here.</li>

<h5>Flowing Forest Course</h5>

This race is located north of the Временой Перекресток, and brings you to a lap around the Shifting Sands.  
<ul>
	<li><b>Обычная трасса:</b></li>
	<ul>
		<li>This race has a lot of turns and not a lot of Wind Gales to carry you through the race, so time your <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/ru/spell=372608"><img src="https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/ability_dragonriding_forwardflap01.jpg" width="11" height="11" valign="bottom" />Рывок вперед</a> uses properly.</li>
		<li>Required time to Gold medal the race: <b>49 seconds</b>.</li>
	</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><b>Продвинутая трасса:</b></li>
	<ul>
		<li>Unlike the Basic race, the Advanced course has a lot of Vigor orbs, so extra caution is advised when using <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/ru/spell=372608"><img src="https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/ability_dragonriding_forwardflap01.jpg" width="11" height="11" valign="bottom" />Рывок вперед</a>, as there are some pretty tight turns that might be hard to do during the burst of speed from the ability.</li>
		<li>Some Vigor orbs are slightly out of the way of the race track, but you should still be able to catch them without too much issue by simply following the race track. They can be a bit hard to reach at high speeds.</li>
		<li>Required time to Gold medal the race: <b>40 seconds</b>.</li>

<h5>Спринт по садам</h5>

This race is located east of the Garden Shrine and brings you on a twisty race around the Gardens of Unity.  
<ul>
	<li><b>Обычная трасса:</b></li>
	<ul>
		<li>The Basic and Advanced pass through a lot of small arches, and because of that, the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/ru/item=194549"><img src="https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/inv_companionpterrordaxdrake.jpg" width="11" height="11" valign="bottom" />Воздушный велоцидракон</a> is the recommended mount to use due to its smaller hitbox.</li>
		<li>There are a lot of turns in this race, so be careful and try to not use <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/ru/spell=372608"><img src="https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/ability_dragonriding_forwardflap01.jpg" width="11" height="11" valign="bottom" />Рывок вперед</a> right before a tight curve.</li>

</ul>

<ul>
	<li><b>Продвинутая трасса:</b></li>
	<ul>
		<li>The race track is the exact same as the Basic version, except it has many more Vigor Orbs compared to Wind Gales on the Basic race. You will never run out of Vigor but some restraint is advised, so you don't hit anything by accident due to being harder to turn while at max Dragonriding speed.</li>

<h5>Испытание в Тирхолде</h5>

This race is located south of Тирхолд and sends you around the Passage of Time and Тирхолд areas.  
<ul>
	<li><b>Обычная трасса:</b></li>
	<ul>
		<li>This race has only a couple Wind Gales through most of it (and notably, zero wind gales in the areas before the first upwards gale), so be mindful of your Vigor to not run out at important times!</li>
		<li>This is one of the only races in the game with upwards Wind Gales - Wind Gales pointing up that will propel you very high upwards. This will make you lose momentum and you'll lose control off your mount until the propelling is done, so make sure to use <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/ru/spell=372608"><img src="https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/ability_dragonriding_forwardflap01.jpg" width="11" height="11" valign="bottom" />Рывок вперед</a> immediately after you regain control of your mount to regain momentum! There is always a Vigor orb before an upwards gale so you'll always have at least 1 Vigor to regain momentum.</li>
		<li>Be mindful that you will lose all momentum and <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/ru/spell=383366"><img src="https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/ability_dragonriding_thrilloftheskies01.jpg" width="11" height="11" valign="bottom" />Азарт небес</a> when propelled upwards, so you will not regenerate Vigor while waiting for the propelling to end. Manage your Vigor according so you don't run out!</li>
		<li>Required time to Gold medal the race: <b>81 seconds</b>.</li>
	</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><b>Продвинутая трасса:</b></li>
	<ul>
		<li>The Advanced Course is slightly different at the start than the Basic Course, with the rings guiding you through more turns and smaller enclosures. Be careful to not hit the ground and lose momentum.</li>
		<li>The Gold time for the Advanced race is far less forgiving, so you must use your Vigor as you regenerate it! This race is not recommended doing without the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/ru/spell=377967"><img src="https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/ability_dragonriding_athomealoft01.jpg" width="11" height="11" valign="bottom" />Дом в небе</a> Dragonriding talent.</li>
