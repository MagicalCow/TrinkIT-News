Blizzard has updated the trinket <a href="/item=19339">Mind Quickening Gem</a> after community concerns were raised, asking if Blizzard could just ban the item in arenas instead of nerfing the haste bonus altogether. <br /><br /><div class="quote">We have one update to the patch that we want to make very clear. Previously in testing, we were adjusting the Haste that Mind Quickening Gem provided across the board. Weâ€™ve narrowed the scope of the adjustment:<br /><ul><li>Mind Quickening Gem is no longer usable in Arenas. The trinket is unchanged in all other areas of play.
