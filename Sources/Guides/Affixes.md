Welcome to this week's dungeons. <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/affix=11">Bursting</a>, <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/affix=3">Volcanic</a>, <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/affix=9">Tyrannical</a>, and <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/affix=128">Tormented</a> are this week's affixes! This week is one of the top push weeks on the calendar. 

You are going to be able to get a large amount of score this week for the Tyrannical weeks if it is your goal. This is due to the affixes being minimally intrusive on strategy and the timer almost uniformly across the board. Any way to mass remove <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/affix=11">Bursting</a> is also super valuable, but with the general layout of dungeons this expansion, rolling Bursting is relatively difficult. Play safe and you should be able to time keys 1-2 levels higher than normal weeks.

### Necrotic Wake
Necrotic Wake's timer is one of the most forgiving out of all the dungeons you can select from. This means that as long as you play a safer strategy and can kill the bosses then you should be good to go. For general advice, using many <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/spell=328351">Bloody Javelin</a>'s on bosses is your best bet. The bosses are above and beyond the most difficult part of this dungeon, so using the Javelins on bosses is preferred. <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/spell=328404">Discharged Anima</a> and <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/spell=335161">Anima Exhaust</a> are both really powerful AOE effects in these dungeons and should be used to blow up trash packs in between times that you have cooldowns.

**Tips for Necrotic Wake this week**  
Realistically, the affixes in this dungeon are minimally intrusive. Notably as well, the <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/npc=165138">Blight Bag</a> do not even do on death affixes in the beginning of the dungeon. This means that the largest majority of this dungeon is based on player performance. This dungeon is quite difficult even still with the high degree of finesse that the weapons can employ. Making sure you understand how to use the weapons at peak value is what turns good groups to great groups. It is <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/affix=9">Tyrannical</a>, so be super careful of the bosses and here are some tips. 

For <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/npc=162691">Blightbone</a> just having the native Kyrian <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/spell=335161">Anima Exhaust</a> ability should do wonders on this boss. A lot of people will also elect to use a <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/spell=328351">Bloody Javelin</a> on Blightbone + a surrounding trash pack or a <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/affix=128">Tormented</a> mob in order to execute them. 

For <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/npc=163157">Amarth</a> as well if you CC the adds during the <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/spell=321247">Final Harvest</a> that are still up then the adds do not get consumed and wipe you. You will see top groups CC the mages with <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/spell=115078">Paralysis</a> or <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/spell=9484">Shackle Undead</a> on every set to avoid having to kill the adds, and you can see that discussed in this <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news/crowd-control-on-amarth-in-necrotic-wake-mythic-tip-of-the-week-322272">tip of the week</a>. This does require coordination though. <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/spell=328351">Bloody Javelin</a> is typically used on Amarth in conjunction with a <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/affix=128">Tormented</a> mob. You can see this performed below.

For <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/npc=162689">Surgeon Stitchflesh</a> saving a <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/spell=328351">Bloody Javelin</a> is very common practice and using the Javelin on the first add + boss to make sure you do not have multiple adds and have potential to 1 phase the boss. If you miss the javelin on the first <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/npc=172981">Kyrian Stitchwerk</a> then you may potentially have to focus the Stitchwerk or use hammers on the boss. The boss also notably does **NOT CAST HIS ESCAPE SUB 5% HP**. Alternatively, you can use very powerful CDs such as <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/spell=316958">Ashen Hallow</a> + <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/spell=290583">Bloodlust</a>, but it ultimately depends on the group and the key level. If you leave this boss alive too long and have multiple adds up you can wipe. 

Lastly for <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/npc=162693">Nalthor the Rimebinder</a> it is really typical to have <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/spell=290583">Bloodlust</a> and to not use it on Stitchflesh. You also want to <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/spell=328126">Forgotten Forgehammer</a> on <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/spell=321754">Icebound Aegis</a> shields in which you have multiple DPS downstairs from <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/spell=321894">Dark Exile</a>. Here is also a nice point to use Battle Rezzes and sacrifice people to the Dark Exile. This can save you time on the boss as a whole. 

Also, if you have a priest who is feeling very youthful (and you have Battle Rezzes), you can <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/spell=73325">Leap of Faith</a> the <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/spell=321894">Dark Exile</a> if used at the correct timing. That was performed multiple during the MDI, and you can see what it looks like <a href="https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkx0WrbueUlQtx_Etfr-SM33gu5n9mZaWNU" rel="nofollow">here</a>!

### Sanguine Depths
The affixes in Sanguine Depths are some of the most advantageous that you can find due to the lack of intrusiveness this week provides. There are some other weeks that can potentially be better for Sanguine Depths due to the ease of refreshing <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/spell=340433">Sinfall Boon</a>. For many normal groups that play the lanterns slower, then this week is for you. It is <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/affix=9">Tyrannical</a> and this dungeon has some really difficult bosses, but if you are able to pull off the bosses you are good to go. 

**Tips for Sanguine Depths this week**

A massive tip involves the <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/spell=340433">Sinfall Boon</a> lanterns and how to extend stacks **FOR FREE**! For the low low cost of 1 <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/item=117569">Giant Deathweb Egg</a> or a <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/item=23767">Crashin' Thrashin' Robot</a> you too can gain another stack of the <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/spell=340433">Sinfall Boon</a> buff. 

The biggest pain points in Sanguine Depths are the bosses. Making sure you have <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/spell=290583">Bloodlust</a> for most of the bosses will yield the best results. In Sanguine Depths you are probably afforded a full wipe to trash in bonus time that you have. You are not afforded the same luxury to wiping to bosses though. Making sure you have solid strategies for all 4 bosses in Sanguine Depths is the most important thing.

*  <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/npc=162100">Kryxis the Voracious</a> - Just making sure you drop the <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/spell=319685">Severing Smash</a> orbs in a solid spot and soak the <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/spell=319713">Juggernaut Rush</a> and you will be fine.  
*  <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/npc=162103">Executor Tarvold</a> - Make sure you have all offensive cooldowns and focus down adds quickly. Having the <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/spell=340433">Sinfall Boon</a> lantern buff is also very strong.  
*  <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/npc=162102">Grand Proctor Beryllia</a> - Try to soak 3 - 4 stacks every time of the orbs and use strong personals. If you are doing a high enough key rotating immunities and allowing other players to soak 4 stacks of the orbs is a common strategy.   
*  <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/npc=165318">General Kaal</a> - is only dangerous due to the trash in the gauntlet. The boss itself is quite easy on this week if you can deal with the trash. All of the trash except for the <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/npc=167955">Sanguine Cadet</a> DO NOT do on death affixes. These mobs do, so be cautious.</li></ul>

### Spires of Ascension
Spires is fairly free this week assuming you have enough damage to chew through the bosses HP on <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/affix=9">Tyrannical</a>. On <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/affix=3">Volcanic</a> &amp; <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/affix=11">Bursting</a> these are effectively non-affixes as the mob density in Spires is not high enough to make Bolstering relevant. At the same time Volcanic is... Volcanic. 

**Tips for Spires of Ascension this week**

Here are some helpful tips for the bosses in general in Spires of Ascension:

*  <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/npc=163077">Azules</a> - You should look to have <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/spell=290583">Bloodlust</a> for this boss this week. There are some weeks where you can lust the first pull and that is totally acceptable, this week you absolutely can look to lust this boss. Additionally, if you are playing in a hyper coordinated group you can CC the <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/npc=163459">Forsworn Mender</a> in the pull in front of the first boss, take this mob into the pull, and use the weapon purge to do just a little bit more damage to the boss.   
*  <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/npc=162058">Ventunax</a> - Similar to Kin-Tara you should look to have <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/spell=290583">Bloodlust</a> available for this boss. This is due to the fact that this boss is the breaking point for a lot of groups. There is high difficulty in dodging while also making sure the party does not bleed out to the bleed. You can aggressively use bleed removal tools such as <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/spell=1022">Blessing of Protection</a> super early (second bleed is pretty normal). Additionally, the bleed will only go on eligible ranged targets, so in some comps this can be only one person, so be careful.  
*  <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/npc=162060">Oryphrion</a> - This boss is about mana and <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/spell=324608">Charged Stomp</a> management. Making sure you push the boss into the vulnerability window as fast as you deem fit is important. You can force the boss to stomp if your tank is inside of his hitbox and avoid him stomping if your tank is slightly outside of the hitbox. Additionally, you can <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/spell=122783">Diffuse Magic</a> the stomp DOT back onto the boss (if your windwalker is stacked on top of the tank when the stomp is going off), which is very powerful. Doing this right before a vulnerability phase is a lot of damage and another reason Windwalker is OP.  
*  <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/npc=167410">Devos</a> - Is just a very long boss. Make sure you do not bleed out to the dispels and just make sure to bait the <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/spell=323943">Run Through</a> towards the back of the room. This will allow melee a lot higher uptime on the boss. You can also use the Corgi-Goggles toy on the big annoying angle to turn her into a Corgi if you want more screen real estate.</li></ul>

### Halls of Atonement
Halls of Atonement is a &quot;Hold W&quot; kind of dungeon on this week's affixes. The only thing that is difficult on this affix set remotely is potential time losses due to <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/affix=9">Tyrannical</a>. If your group has no wipes and you pull reasonable then you will easily time this key.

**Tips for Halls of Atonement this week**

Skipping either <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/npc=179892">Oros Coldheart</a> or <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/npc=179891">Soggodon the Breaker</a> are great options on this week's affix set if you need to make up some time. Oros is a bit difficult to dodge the statues with the slow, but if you play close to the boss and tank the boss near the wall then dodging should be pretty easy. <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/npc=164218">Lord Chamberlain</a>'s tank bleed does not get amplified by the negative debuff, so the only things that are physical are the Statue Toss and the normal Melees. This means you can easily get one shot by the statues if you get hit, but this is a common occurrence regardless. 

Beyond this, another good tip is to use the <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/npc=174175">Loyal Stoneborn</a> on <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/npc=179890">Executioner Varruth</a> on the right side near the shard. The reason for this (and why you should not use it on any other trash pulls) is that this mob is a lot more dangerous and the stoneborns are a lot more valuable on Single Target than AOE. This will also allow you to use a lot fewer DPS cds / Healer cds.

### Mists of Tirna Scithe
This is probably the best <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/affix=9">Tyrannical</a> week for Mists that you can get. This is due to the fact that you have effectively unlimited pull size potential in the maze. This makes your timer largely trivial. 

**Tips for Mists of Tirna Scithe this week**
First off: Do not merge any packs with <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/npc=166301">Mistveil Stalker</a> in them. The bite from this mob is very dangerous and while it can be stopped, if you have 2 go off on 1 person they will get one shot. 

Second off: Having 3 DPS run <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/spell=209862">Volcanic Plume</a> is really strong. This can cancel many casts inside of the maze and can save you a significant amount of time. It significantly increases melee uptime as a whole and allows your tank a large amount of uptime he otherwise would not have as well. Be cautious of getting juked on kicks. 

A massive thing you can do that can help you with <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/npc=164567">Ingra Maloch</a> is using a pet to pull the 3rd <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/affix=128">Tormented</a> mob through the wall prior to engaging the boss. You just use a <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/spell=287988">Pet Attack</a> on the tormented mob through the wall, pull the pet back and he will come through the wall. 

You can read about strategies involving pulling trash through the wall <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news/pulling-extra-maze-trash-in-mists-of-tirna-scithe-mythic-tip-of-the-week-323967">here</a>! Also, there are ways to pull mobs through the walls of the maze using a Dwarf (or cat form druid) model as they are smaller. Like I said above though, be super careful of what packs are being merged. Many if not most of the walls have spots like this, and it just takes time to figure out where these spots are. Here is an example of this:

### Plaguefall
Plaguefall still has a lenient timer this season regardless of what affixes face you. The bosses in this dungeon can be a bit difficult, but they are not something to be overly worried about as long as you have strong coordination. 

**Tips for Plaguefall this week**
There are 2 bosses and 2 trash pulls that are typically seen as harder than the rest in this dungeon on this week's affixes. This is due to the fact that you cannot just pull as large as you want on the <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/npc=163857">Plaguebound Devoted</a> &amp; <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/npc=168969">Gushing Slime</a> pulls while <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/npc=164255">Globgrog</a> &amp; <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/npc=164267">Margrave Stradama</a> are very challenging bosses. 

*  <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/npc=163857">Plaguebound Devoted</a> - This pull is very dangerous if you pull the whole room. Be super cautious of your <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/affix=11">Bursting</a> stacks and avoid rolling bursting at all costs. You can desync the pulls a bit by pulling the room 1 pull at a time.  
*  <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/npc=168969">Gushing Slime</a> - Break this pull up into 3 smaller pulls will yield the best results. If you are feeling ambitious, you can pull a few into the Tormented mob you have to fight, but be SUPER careful doing that.  
*  <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/npc=164255">Globgrog</a> - You have to make sure you get CC on his slimes on his summon cast. If you do not CC the big slime you are going to wipe. Beyond this, determining whether you have a comp to perma root the small slimes or potentially just kill them is also something you need to determine before the key. You can also drag a red slime into this boss room and stand in the haste zone during the fight to have substantially higher DPS. A clip is attached below.  
*  <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/npc=164267">Margrave Stradama</a> - This fight is about cooldown management. You can realistically have 1 very powerful cooldown or 2 medium strength cooldowns for each upstairs phase to help you burn the boss. This will yield the best results.</li></ul>

### Theater of Pain
This is one of the better Theater of Pain weeks. It is a 5 boss instance on <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/affix=9">Tyrannical</a>, so you can run into time trouble. If you have enough damage and avoid wipes the dungeon should be fairly free on this week's affixes. 

**Tips for Theater of Pain this week**

<a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/npc=179892">Oros Coldheart</a> should be skipped 100% of the time if you reasonably can. This will allow you to save a significant amount of time over the alternative of playing the incredibly slow Oros (see what I did there). Additionally, the last boss with the slow is not too bad. 

Beyond skipping oros, there is not too much else you can reasonably do in Theater of Pain. The dungeon is incredibly on rails and if you have done it once you've done it 100 times. 

Theater of Pain Guide

### De Other Side
De Other Side is a dungeon that is make or break based on how big you can pull the Ardenweald wing. You need to be super cautious of <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/affix=11">Bursting</a> in the Ardenweald wing as this is one of the most common spots in all of Shadowlands where people will roll bursting. Beyond that, it is just about killing bosses. 

**Tips for De Other Side this week**
The biggest tips I have for De Other Side relate to <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/npc=169769">Mueh'zala</a> and <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/npc=166473">Hakkar the Soulflayer</a>. For Mueh'zala making sure that you have the appropriate amount of DPS cds for the totems is the most critical point. This can potentially mean you have a Holy Paladin solo an add with <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/spell=316958">Ashen Hallow</a> while sending a tank and one of your worse DPS classes to a totem together. As for Hakkar, a late <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/spell=290583">Bloodlust</a> is common at higher levels of keys where you will not be able to kill the boss 100-0 inside of the lust. This is due to the fact that you want the lust and other offensive cds to kill off adds.

If you are reading this and you plan on going around the ring, picking up all anima powers, then going into a specific wing, please stop doing that immediately. Go left off the start and go straight into the Ardenweald area. This allows you to pick up <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/npc=179892">Oros Coldheart</a> powers and notably <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/npc=179890">Executioner Varruth</a> powers which are the dps powers. Doing this also minimizes backtracking in a key where the timer is tight. 

The last thing is there is some cool tech on <a href="https://ru.wowhead.com/npc=164450">Dealer Xy'exa</a> if you are feeling ambitious enough :).
