[b]2022's Lunar Festival starts January 30th and ends February 13th[\/b] in WoW Burning Crusade Classic. The Lunar Festival is held every year starting on a date that typically coincides with the Chinese New Year.

Ancestors of Azeroth across Kalimdor and East Kingdoms are praised and honored by both Horde and Alliance. There's a celebration in Moonglade, and numerous  [item=21100] quests to complete and collect to purchase festive garb, profession patterns, and fireworks!

This guide covers all the items you can buy, quests you can complete, and locations of all the elders.

[minor-heading]Differences between Burning Crusade and Retail Lunar Festivals[\/minor-heading]
[pad]
For those players who have been doing the Lunar Festival activities over the year, you'll find some important differences to consider between Classic Lunar Festival and what it has become. Fundamentally, there has been little change over the years in how the Festival is celebrated, but the particulars are not quite the same.

[ul]
[li]Many Elders are not in the same places between Retail and Burning Crusade Classic. After Cataclysm, many elders changed locations due to zone changes. Some did not actually change locations, but the overall zone coordinates changed, so Retail information about coordinates can lead you astray.[\/li]

[li]In Burning Crusade Classic, Elder quests giving [item=21100]  give reputation, but no experience. [\/li]

[li][item=21100]  quests give a [item=21746] but at different times. In both, you get the [item=21100]  right away.  In Retail, you also receive the   [item=21746]  right away. In Burning Crusade , the  [item=21746]  will appear in your mailbox a couple hours after completing the elder's quest.[\/li]

[li]Vendors have much more limited stock.[\/li]

[li]Festival items such as fireworks, recipes, and Festival Suits\/Dresses are gained through quests, not through traditional vendors. These quests do not give experience.[\/li]

[li]Achievements are present in Retail but not in Burning Crusade Classic.[\/li]

[h2 toc=\"Getting to Moonglade\"]The Lunar Festival Quests: Getting to Moonglade[\/h2]


[h4]Lunar Emissary \/ Lunar Herald[\/h4]

In each of the six major cities, you will find quest givers that will give you the first quest to the Lunar Festival. These are called Lunar Festival Emissaries on the Alliance side and Lunar Festival Heralds on the Horde side. While it's not strictly necessary to start with these NPCs -- you can go directly to the Lunar Festival areas and pick up the first quests there -- these quests do give you 5 [faction=609] reputation, so starting with the breadcrumb does give a small reward.

[h4]Lunar Festival Harbinger[\/h4]

The Lunar Festival Harbinger is located in the main Lunar Festival areas of each of the six major cities. The Elders assigned to each city can also be found here.

You can go directly to the Lunar Festival Harbingers in each city rather than going through the Lunar Festival Emissary or Herald if you prefer. This starts the quest line that gets you easy access to Moonglade.

[h4]Lunar Harbinger Quests:[\/h4]

[b][quest=8867]: [\/b]
[quote]Launch 8 Lunar Fireworks and 2 Cluster Fireworks and return to a Lunar Festival Harbinger at any capital city.[\/quote]


The lunar fireworks can be purchased from a [npc=15898], located near the Lunar Festival Harbingers. You need to purchase 8 Small Rockets and 2 Rocket Clusters. Color doesn't matter. The prices are not affected by city reputation, as these vendors are on [faction=609] reputation. The entire purchase will cost [money=000400].

You can launch these right next to the vendor. They will go off in rocket launchers located in the center of the Lunar Festival gathering.

[center][screenshot id=903512 size=normal][\/screenshot][\/center]

Turn in this quest and you will receive [item=21711] and 50 Reputation with [faction=609] (no experience).
[br]
[h4][item=21711][\/h4]
[pad]
The [item=21711] is your ticket to Moonglade and beyond. Your first use for it is to complete the followup quest, 

[b][quest=8883][\/b]
[quote][i]Use your Lunar Festival Invitation in the moonlight to travel to Moonglade. Speak with Valadar Starsong in Nighthaven when you arrive.[\/i][\/quote]

For non-druids, this is by far the easiest way to reach Moonglade. Go into the empty moonlight in the middle of the Lunar Festival area and click on your [item=21711]. This will teleport you to Moonglade, in an area southwest of the village of Nighthaven.  Follow the road heading north into Nighthaven to [npc=15864] to turn in this quest.

The  [item=21711] doesn't disappear at this point -- at least not right away. It lasts 24 hours after picking it up. If your invitation has disappeared and you want another one, return to any [npc=15895] to pick up another one.

[item=21711] has a 10-minute cooldown. 

[h4]A few interesting uses of the Lunar Festival Invitation:[\/h4]
[ul]
[li]This is the easiest way to pick up the Moonglade flight point if you're not a druid. Make sure to visit the flight masters here: [icon name=side_alliance][\/icon][npc=10897] at \/way 48, 67, or [icon name=side_horde][\/icon][npc=12740] at \/way 32, 66.[\/li]
[li]Even with the 10-minute cooldown, it can be the quickest way to go between Darnassus and Ironforge\/Stormwind or between Undercity and Orgrimmar\/Thunder Bluff. It's particularly great for moving baby night elves safely from Kalimdor to East Kingdoms.[\/li]

Elune's Candle has some negative effect on Omen and his minions. It will freeze his minions in place, and damages both minions and Omen himself. Otherwise, it shoots fireworks. It is a charged item (88 charges). The item is unique and the quest is one-time only, but the item is not soulbound, so you can mail extras to alts. 

One handy off-label use is that [icon name=class_paladin][\/icon][color=c2]Paladins [\/color]can use it for pulling.  

[br]
[major-heading]Moonglade Raid Quest: Omen[\/major-heading]
[pad]

[quest=8868] (minimum level 40). Rewards [money=009000], [item=21540], [item=21640], 6,600 experience and 100 reputation with [faction=609].
[quote][i]Summon Omen, defeat him and gain Elune's Blessing. Return to Valadar Starsong in Nighthaven[\/i][\/quote]

Omen is found wandering near \/way 62,66 and is a raid-level boss requiring large numbers of players to defeat him. 

Once he is dead, you need to stand in his corpse for several seconds (20 or more in some cases) to receive the Elune's Blessing buff. Once you have this buff, return to Valadar Stormwing to turn this quest in.

It isn't even necessary to tag Omen yourself; if he's already dead when you get there, stand on his corpse and unless he decays while you're there, you can receive the blessing and fulfill the quest.

[major-heading]Elders: Collecting Coins of Ancestry[\/major-heading]
[pad]
[screenshot id=903535 size=normal height=275 float=right][\/screenshot]
One of the biggest activities of the Lunar Festival is visiting Elders around Kalimdor and East Kingdoms and Kalimdor. Each Elder has a quest that will reward one [item=21100] and 50 Horde or Alliance reputation (55 for [icon name=race_human_male]Humans.[\/icon]). A couple of hours after visiting an Elder, you will also receive a [item=21746] in your mail. This can contain one of two items: a [item=21744] or [item=21745]. You may visit each Elder only once per Lunar Festival.

Elders are found in a circle of light, with a yellow [icon name=quest_start][\/icon] over their heads. They appear as ghostly Tauren, Dwarves or Night Elves wearing Festive Dresses or Festive Pant Suits. 

Elders in the major cities are located in the Lunar Festival areas, near the Lunar Harbingers. That makes them easy to find for same-faction seekers.

Elders are neutral to all visitors, so both Horde and Alliance may visit any of them. While you may visit and get a coin from any Elder starting at level 1, many of these areas will be dangerous, if not downright fatal, for lower-level characters. Some locations are close to opposite-faction guards. And needless to say, those deep inside hostile capital cities are only pursued by those bravest and most foolhardy of adventurers!

There are 24 Elders in Kalimdor and 20 in Eastern Kingdoms.
