## Best Feral Druid Enchants

Shadowlands comes with more slots that can be enchanted again. Let's have a look at the slots and their recommendations.

- **Cloak**:  
    For your back slot you've got a variety of options. All of which have their own advantages and disadvantages. I'd recommend [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_enchantedscroll.gif) Enchant Cloak - Fortified Avoidance](https://www.wowhead.com/item=172411/enchant-cloak-fortified-avoidance) as the general choice.

    - [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_enchantedscroll.gif) Enchant Cloak - Fortified Avoidance](https://www.wowhead.com/item=172411/enchant-cloak-fortified-avoidance)

    - [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_enchantedscroll.gif) Enchant Cloak - Fortified Leech](https://www.wowhead.com/item=172412/enchant-cloak-fortified-leech)

    - [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_enchantedscroll.gif) Enchant Cloak - Fortified Speed](https://www.wowhead.com/item=172410/enchant-cloak-fortified-speed)

    - [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_enchantedscroll.gif) Enchant Cloak - Soul Vitality](https://www.wowhead.com/item=177660/enchant-cloak-soul-vitality)

- **Chest**:  
     [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_enchantedscroll.gif) Enchant Chest - Eternal Stats](https://www.wowhead.com/item=177962/enchant-chest-eternal-stats) Is the no brainer here. ( [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_enchantedscroll.gif) Enchant Chest - Sacred Stats](https://www.wowhead.com/item=177716/enchant-chest-sacred-stats) if you want to save some gold.)
- **Wrists**: (optional)  
    The stat type for this slot is Intellect, which obviously does not benefit Feral, but may benefit an offspec. You can also use [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_enchantedscroll.gif) Enchant Bracers - Shaded Hearthing](https://www.wowhead.com/item=172416/enchant-bracers-shaded-hearthing).
- **Gloves**: (optional)  
    The stat type for this slot is Strength, which again, does not benefit Feral. You can use [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_enchantedscroll.gif) Enchant Gloves - Shadowlands Gathering](https://www.wowhead.com/item=172406/enchant-gloves-shadowlands-gathering) instead.
- **Boots**:  
    The stat type for this slot is Agility. You want [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_enchantedscroll.gif) Enchant Boots - Eternal Agility](https://www.wowhead.com/item=172419/enchant-boots-eternal-agility). (to save gold you can use [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_enchantedscroll.gif) Enchant Boots - Agile Soulwalker](https://www.wowhead.com/item=172413/enchant-boots-agile-soulwalker).)
- **Rings**:  
    For the ring slot you can choose any secondary stat so you'll want to use your preferred stat, which is probably [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_enchantedscroll.gif) Enchant Ring - Tenet of Critical Strike](https://www.wowhead.com/item=172361/enchant-ring-tenet-of-critical-strike). (To save some gold you can use [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/trade_engraving.gif) Bargain of Critical Strike](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=309612/bargain-of-critical-strike).)
- **Weapons**:  
    Weapon enchants come with damage effects this time. Your choices are:

    - [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_enchantedscroll.gif) Enchant Weapon - Celestial Guidance](https://www.wowhead.com/item=172366/enchant-weapon-celestial-guidance): This is a primary stat proc and the most generic enchant.

    - [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_enchantedscroll.gif) Enchant Weapon - Lightless Force](https://www.wowhead.com/item=172370/enchant-weapon-lightless-force): This one scales in AoE and is thus a choice favoring content like Mythic+.

    - [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_enchantedscroll.gif) Enchant Weapon - Sinful Revelation](https://www.wowhead.com/item=172368/enchant-weapon-sinful-revelation): This enchant is focused on a single / priority target.
    My recommendation would be to use [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_enchantedscroll.gif) Enchant Weapon - Celestial Guidance](https://www.wowhead.com/item=172366/enchant-weapon-celestial-guidance), as a general purpose enchant, if you want to specialize for particular content then you'll want to swap to one of the more specalised enchants.
## Best Feral Druid Potions and Flasks

- **Flask**: [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_alchemy_90_flask_green.gif) Spectral Flask of Power](https://www.wowhead.com/item=171276/spectral-flask-of-power)

- **Damage Potion:**[![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_alchemy_90_combat2_green.gif) Potion of Spectral Agility](https://www.wowhead.com/item=171270/potion-of-spectral-agility)

- **Healing Potion**: [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/trade_alchemy_potionb5.gif) Cosmic Healing Potion](https://www.wowhead.com/item=187802/cosmic-healing-potion)
## Best Feral Druid Enhancements

There are a number of noteworthy additional enhancements.

- **Rune**:  
     [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_gem_azuredraenite_01.gif) Veiled Augment Rune](https://www.wowhead.com/item=181468/veiled-augment-rune)
- **Weapon Oil**:  
    A returning consumable in Shadowlands is Weapon Oils. As a Druid, you want to use [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_blacksmithing_greatersharpeningstone.gif) Shaded Sharpening Stone](https://www.wowhead.com/item=171437/shaded-sharpening-stone) or [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_blacksmithing_greaterweightstone.gif) Shaded Weightstone](https://www.wowhead.com/item=171439/shaded-weightstone).
- **Armor Kit**:  
    Another returning consumable. [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_leatherworking_armorpatch_heavy.gif) Heavy Desolate Armor Kit](https://www.wowhead.com/item=172347/heavy-desolate-armor-kit) (and to save gold [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_leatherworking_armorpatch_light.gif) Desolate Armor Kit](https://www.wowhead.com/item=172346/desolate-armor-kit)).
## Best Feral Druid Food

The best food in Shadowlands is Primary stat from feasts. The best version is [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_tradeskill_cooking_shadowlandsfeast_large01.gif) Feast of Gluttonous Hedonism](https://www.wowhead.com/item=172043/feast-of-gluttonous-hedonism) and to save some gold [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_tradeskill_cooking_shadowlandsfeast_small01.gif) Surprisingly Palatable Feast](https://www.wowhead.com/item=172042/surprisingly-palatable-feast).  

If no feast is available you should pick your favorite secondary stat food which is likely [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_cooking_90_phantasmalsoufflefries.gif) Spinefin Souffle and Fries](https://www.wowhead.com/item=172041/spinefin-souffle-and-fries) or (you get the idea) to save some gold, [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_cooking_90_butterscotchmarinatedribs.gif) Butterscotch Marinated Ribs](https://www.wowhead.com/item=172040/butterscotch-marinated-ribs)).

## Best Feral Druid Gems

Your sockets should be your favourite secondary stat, which if you've been following along you should be able to guess is [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelcrafting_90_rarecut_orange.gif) Deadly Jewel Cluster](https://www.wowhead.com/item=173127/deadly-jewel-cluster).
