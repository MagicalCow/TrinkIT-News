# Torghast Jailer's Gauntlet in Shadowlands Patch 9.2

> Jailer's Gauntlet, aka Boss Rush, is a fast-paced 4-layer wing in Torghast with targeted fights against bosses. Find out about the structure, strategy, rewards, and tips for defeating Jailer's Gauntlet!

Patch 9.2 introduces a new type of Torghast encounter with the Jailer's Gauntlet, aka "Boss Rush". Instead of long levels of trash with trash, traps, puzzles, and events, this fast and furious method is a series of quick boss fights in small packs. Completing layers of the Jailer's Gauntlet gives rewards such as a pet, new Hearthstone toy, a title, and the [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_mawratmount_05.gif) Огромная эбеновая крыса Утробы](https://ru.wowhead.com/spell=363136/%D0%BE%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F-%D1%8D%D0%B1%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%8F-%D0%BA%D1%80%D1%8B%D1%81%D0%B0-%D1%83%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%8B) mount!

This fun, fast-paced alternative to traditional Torghast can be completed (at the appropriate layers for level) in under 30 minutes without hurrying. The quick succession of layers, plenty of high-powered Anima Powers given on each floor, and no time-wasting rooms full of trash packs breathes new life into the Torghast experience.

In addition to cosmetic rewards, both for completing layers and for items you'd normally get running Adamant Vaults, Jailer's Gauntlet also offers [ ![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_soulash.gif) Пепел душ](https://ru.wowhead.com/currency=1828/%D0%BF%D0%B5%D0%BF%D0%B5%D0%BB-%D0%B4%D1%83%D1%88), [ ![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_supersoulash.gif) Угли душ](https://ru.wowhead.com/currency=1906/%D1%83%D0%B3%D0%BB%D0%B8-%D0%B4%D1%83%D1%88), and [ ![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_currency_cosmicflux.gif) Космический ветер](https://ru.wowhead.com/currency=2009/%D0%BA%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9-%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80).

Jailer's Gauntlet Overview
--------------------------

Jailer's Gauntlet is somewhat more reminiscent of Twisting Corridors than of the current Torghast wings. In some ways, the Jailer's Gauntlet feels like it was developed before the major Torghast changes of 9.1, but introduction was delayed for some reason. Here are the ways that Jailer's Gauntlet provides a bit more of an old-school experience:

*   The Box of Many Things doesn't apply, so there are no Torments or Blessings.
    
*   There is no timer to beat.
    
*   The Death Rule is back. You are allowed up to 5 deaths before the Tarragrue shows up.
    
*   f you die on a level, the boss resets to full health.
    

However, the Jailer's Gauntlet also lacks many things a normal Torghast run will have:

*   No trash packs beyond a few that might spawn from portals
    
*   No traps
    
*   No events, puzzles, or chests
    
*   No Ashen Phylacteries
    
*   No Mawrats
    
*   No Souls to rescue in any form
    

  

How the Jailer's Gauntlet Works
-------------------------------

The entrance to the Jailer's Gauntlet is located on the far right end of the Torghast entrances, to the right of the entrance to Twisting Corridors.

[![](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/1045641.jpg?maxWidth=1050)](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/1045641.jpg)

The Jailer's Gauntlet is made up of 8 floors with 4 difficulty layers. The recommended iLevel requirements for each layer are as follows:

<table><tbody><tr><td data-background="c6"><b>Layer</b></td><td data-background="c6"><b>Rec. iLvl</b></td></tr><tr><td>Layer 1</td><td>230</td></tr><tr><td>Layer 2</td><td>245</td></tr><tr><td>Layer 3</td><td>260</td></tr><tr><td>Layer 4</td><td>275</td></tr></tbody></table>

Like other Torghast modes, you need to earn your way up levels, but progress is account wide. Your first character to do these on your account will have to start at Layer 1, no matter how high their iLevel is, and work their way up layer by layer. Subsequent characters will have access to whatever layers the other characters on your account have opened up.

All earned permanent Torghast upgrades such as [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/sha_spell_warlock_demonsoul_nightborne.gif) Сосуд несчастных душ](https://ru.wowhead.com/item=184620/%D1%81%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%83%D0%B4-%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%87%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BD%D1%8B%D1%85-%D0%B4%D1%83%D1%88), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelcrafting_815_focusinglens.gif) Лупа необычных чар](https://ru.wowhead.com/item=184619/%D0%BB%D1%83%D0%BF%D0%B0-%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%8B%D1%87%D0%BD%D1%8B%D1%85-%D1%87%D0%B0%D1%80), and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_animamaw_buff.gif) Матрица возможностей](https://ru.wowhead.com/item=180952/%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B0-%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B7%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%B6%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%B9) will also apply within Jailer's Gauntlet.

Completing layers each layer also gives a reward, which will be covered in detail later.

### Jailer's Gauntlet Bosses

You can't have a Boss Rush without bosses! There are four types of mobs that spawn in Jailer's Gauntlet:

*   **Small trash packs** of normal mobs. These are more common in lower Layers.
    

*   **Silver Rare Elites (Level 61)**. These are the special bosses that can appear anywhere in Torghast, such as [(NPC #185102)](https://ru.wowhead.com/npc=185102), [(NPC #185121)](https://ru.wowhead.com/npc=185121), and [Сумрачный землетряс](https://ru.wowhead.com/npc=152508/%D1%81%D1%83%D0%BC%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%87%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9-%D0%B7%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%BB%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%80%D1%8F%D1%81). These drop the same special, boss-specific powers they would normally drop in regular Torghast.
    
*   **Layer Boss Elites (Level 62)**. These are the level 62 bosses that appear on Floor 5 of a normal Torghast run. These include such bosses as [Синод](https://ru.wowhead.com/npc=159190/%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B4), [Великий Маллеар](https://ru.wowhead.com/npc=159755/%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9-%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B0%D1%80), and [Тюремщик Скольд](https://ru.wowhead.com/npc=151329/%D1%82%D1%8E%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BC%D1%89%D0%B8%D0%BA-%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%B4).
    

The only layer that has a predictable subset of Level 62 Layer Bosses is Floor 8, the final floor based off Adamant Vaults.

From here on out, Level 60 Gold Elites and Level 61 Silver Rare Elites will be referred to as Elites, and the Level 62 Elites will be referred to as Bosses. The non-elites that can pop will be referred to as Trash. These become important distinctions when referring to Anima powers later.

### Jailer's Gauntlet, Floor by Floor

The Jailer's Gauntlet is made up of eight floors, each with a small entryway, a single room, and an exit at the end. Floors 1-3 and 5-7 are randomly themed off the normal Torghast wings (Coldheart Interstitia, Fracture Chambers, etc). Both non-elite mobs and various elites/bosses are ones normally found in any Torghast wings. The "theme" of the floor does not predict which mobs will spawn there. Floors 4 (Silver Rare Double Boss Floor) and Floor 8 are themed off the Adamant Vaults, although Floor 4's Silver Elite Rares may be from any wing. Floor 8's bosses come from Adamant Vaults.

Most floors share similar traits.

*   All cooldowns reset when you change floors.
    
*   Floors 2-8 all have a Broker where you can buy all the normal things Brokers have to offer, swap talents, change specializations, etc.
    
*   Floors 1-3 and 5-7 all have an Anima Orb at the exit that gives Epic/Rare powers. There are no exit Anima Orbs when leaving Floors 4 or 8.
    

**Normal floors** have initial spawned mobs with anywhere from 2-5 Portals. Once you have engaged this first spawned group, there will be a delay before the Portals either spawn a small wave of trash mobs, or one Portal spawns an Elite or Boss. As you progress in Layers, this delay gets shorter. The Portal will close after disgorging either one Boss or 2-4 trash mobs. Once it's closed, it can't spawn any more mobs. Keeping track of how many open portals you have will help you know how far you've progressed on that floor and lets you know when you use cooldowns. The level's exit does not open until all Bosses or Trash are dead and all Portals are closed.

[![](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/1045626.jpg?maxWidth=1050)](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/1045626.jpg)  
_A pair of trash mobs with four portals and closed exit in the back_

Once all portals have closed and the exit is open, the Broker's dome disappears and you will need to travel to the next level to change talents or abilities.

**Three floors are not normal floors.**

*   **Floor 1:** Starts with 3 Anima Orbs offering various quality Anima powers, usually Rare and Epic. There is no Broker, but there is an Epic Anima Orb on exit.
    
*   **Floor 4:** This is the Silver Rare Double Boss floor and the portals only spawn Silver Rare Elites. Two will be spawned immediately (there are always two; sometimes one is invisible at first). Portals spawn 1-2 Silver Rare Elites -- rarely 1, usually 2. This is a great opportunity to pick up a lot of unique Anima powers only offered by Silver Rare Elites. There is no Anima Orb on exit.

    _The Silver Elite Double Boss Floor 4 with three Portals_
    

*   **Floor 8:** 2-3 Bosses from Adamant Vaults, which usually includes some combination of [Троз'игал Угнетатель](https://ru.wowhead.com/npc=179526/%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B7%D0%B8%D0%B3%D0%B0%D0%BB-%D1%83%D0%B3%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%8C), [(NPC #185027)](https://ru.wowhead.com/npc=185027), and [(NPC #185028)](https://ru.wowhead.com/npc=185028). There can also be 1 boss from another floor in the mix. Unlike the other floors, the boss composition of Floor 8 is reasonably predictable.
    

### Typical Floor Fight in Jailer's Gauntlet

A typical floor fight will consist of anywhere from 3-5 Bosses or small groups of trash, which spawn at intervals from the Portals. At lower Layers, the rate at which they spawn is fairly slow, but the spawn time becomes faster the higher you go in Layers, so you may end up with several running around at once. Higher Layers are also more likely to have more Portals per floor, more Bosses and fewer trash packs.

Trash packs will drop Normal or Uncommon level Anima Orbs with only 1-2 powers. Bosses will drop up an Anima Orb with up to 3 powers and up to Epic-quality, depending on their own level. If you have time (or good tanks), you can pick these up mid-fight. You can collect several Anima Powers per floor.

On all floors except 4, there will be at least one Level 62 Elite boss, the kinds normally encountered as Floor 5 bosses on regular Torghast, even on Layer 1. Sometimes there will be several on one floor. It can be pretty random. Occasionally, you'll even get repeats of the same boss within the same run of Jailer's Gauntlet. The floor will almost always end with a Level 62 Elite, but you may get more earlier in the floor as well.

### Jailer's Gauntlet as DPS Check

In normal Torghast, the floors get progressively more difficult as you go, offset in part by Anima powers. In Jailer's Gauntlet, the hardest floors are usually the first two, sometimes three. Since you're guaranteed at least one Epic Anima power per level on those that offer Anima Orbs on exit (all but floors 4 and 8), Jailer's Gauntlet actually gets easier as you progress. This is convenient because you will know within the first two floors if the layer is too hard for you. If you can beat level 3, you can complete the rest of the layer, unless you get exceptionally unlucky with Anima choices.

### Jailer's Gauntlet Rewards

Completing each floor gives a small amount of gold (under 2, but mostly serves as a signal that the level has ended and you can proceed to the next floor.

At the end, you have a chance to be awarded random items such as [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_offhand_pvp330_d_02.gif) Осколок силы Смерти](https://ru.wowhead.com/item=187148/%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%BA-%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%BB%D1%8B-%D1%81%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%82%D0%B8) or cosmetic rewards you would normally get through running Adamant Vault levels, such as the [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_komododragon_blue.gif) Душа завролиска](https://ru.wowhead.com/item=185049/%D0%B4%D1%83%D1%88%D0%B0-%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%B2%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0) or the [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_titanium_shield_spike.gif) Камера Адамантовых хранилищ](https://ru.wowhead.com/item=187417/%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B0-%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D1%85-%D1%85%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%89) toy. There are also achievements worth 10 points for completing each layer. For a list of possible drops in Adamant Vaults that you can get from running Jailer's Gauntlet, please see the Rewards section of our Adamant Vaults guide:

You will also receive various amounts of [ ![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_soulash.gif) Пепел душ](https://ru.wowhead.com/currency=1828/%D0%BF%D0%B5%D0%BF%D0%B5%D0%BB-%D0%B4%D1%83%D1%88), [ ![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_supersoulash.gif) Угли душ](https://ru.wowhead.com/currency=1906/%D1%83%D0%B3%D0%BB%D0%B8-%D0%B4%D1%83%D1%88), and [ ![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_currency_cosmicflux.gif) Космический ветер](https://ru.wowhead.com/currency=2009/%D0%BA%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9-%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80) for completing each layer:

Completing each layer successfully also gains special rewards. These are all accountwide:

Earning Phantasma and Soul Remnants in Jailer's Gauntlet
--------------------------------------------------------

You do not loot [ ![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_phantasma.gif) Фантазма](https://ru.wowhead.com/currency=1728/%D1%84%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%BC%D0%B0) in Jailer's Gauntlet, nor can you earn **Soul Remnants** by freeing Souls. Individual mobs no longer drop Phantasma, and there are no Souls or Soul Remnants to free. When you exit one Floor and proceed to the next, you will collect a base amount of 200 [ ![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_phantasma.gif) Фантазма](https://ru.wowhead.com/currency=1728/%D1%84%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%BC%D0%B0) and 4 Soul Remnants. You can acquire more Phantasma and Soul Remnants through Anima powers.

Collecting Soul Remnants in the Jailer's Gauntlet does not count toward the quest [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/quest-start-campaign.gif) Вернуть потерянные души](https://ru.wowhead.com/quest=61334/%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BD%D1%83%D1%82%D1%8C-%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%8F%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5-%D0%B4%D1%83%D1%88%D0%B8), like collecting souls in normal Torghast wings will.

### Anima Powers to Gain More Phantasma

Like in regular Torghast, you can earn extra [ ![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_phantasma.gif) Фантазма](https://ru.wowhead.com/currency=1728/%D1%84%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%BC%D0%B0) by picking Anima powers such as [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_phantasma.gif) Мешок с фантазмой](https://ru.wowhead.com/spell=295072/%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%88%D0%BE%D0%BA-%D1%81-%D1%84%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%B9) (awards 75 [ ![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_phantasma.gif) Фантазма](https://ru.wowhead.com/currency=1728/%D1%84%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%BC%D0%B0)) or [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_phantasma.gif) Обилие фантазмы](https://ru.wowhead.com/spell=295068/%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B5-%D1%84%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%BC%D1%8B) (awards 300 [ ![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_phantasma.gif) Фантазма](https://ru.wowhead.com/currency=1728/%D1%84%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%BC%D0%B0)). In general, these are worth picking up, as long as they're not competing against a massively improved power. Your ability to earn extra Phantasma is limited in Jailer's Gauntlet, and you get a Broker on every floor except level 1.

 [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_phantasma.gif) Много фантазмы](https://ru.wowhead.com/spell=295071/%D0%BC%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE-%D1%84%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%BC%D1%8B) increases [ ![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_phantasma.gif) Фантазма](https://ru.wowhead.com/currency=1728/%D1%84%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%BC%D0%B0) earned by 25%. This means that instead of earning 200 Anima per floor, you'll get 250 (and these properties will stack -- so two iterations of this power will give you 50% extra, three 75% extra, etc.). This can be a significant amount, particularly if you're interested in getting multiple [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_orb_04.gif) Клетка с награбленной анимой](https://ru.wowhead.com/item=168207/%D0%BA%D0%BB%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BA%D0%B0-%D1%81-%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B9-%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%B9)s, depending on floor availability. Certain classes also have must-have abilities that are most easily acquired through the Broker. However, don't go too wild with these, especially at the expense of more useful abilities.

Most classes have a power that will earn them 5 [ ![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_phantasma.gif) Фантазма](https://ru.wowhead.com/currency=1728/%D1%84%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%BC%D0%B0) every time they perform a specific action (examples: [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_paladin_empoweredsealsjustice.gif) Алчный приказ](https://ru.wowhead.com/spell=329165/%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%87%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%B7) for Warriors or [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_pignosemask_a_01.gif) Личина обжоры](https://ru.wowhead.com/spell=320931/%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%B6%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%8B) for Warlocks). It may not sound like much, but the Phantasma tolerances are very tight in Jailer's Gauntlet. You never know when having even an extra 10 or 15 [ ![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_phantasma.gif) Фантазма](https://ru.wowhead.com/currency=1728/%D1%84%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%BC%D0%B0) will allow you to pick up that extra [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_orb_04.gif) Клетка с награбленной анимой](https://ru.wowhead.com/item=168207/%D0%BA%D0%BB%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BA%D0%B0-%D1%81-%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B9-%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%B9) on the next floor. On one recent run, I was literally 4 Phantasma short of being able to pick up an extra power on the final floor, with no way to get more. Frustrating!

### Anima Powers That Rely on Looting Phantasma/Soul Remnants

There are still some Anima powers available in Jailer's Gauntlet that rely on looting or gaining [ ![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_phantasma.gif) Фантазма](https://ru.wowhead.com/currency=1728/%D1%84%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%BC%D0%B0) and Soul Remnants. You can also pick up an Anima power that gives more Phantasma or Soul Remnants, and these powers will also trigger on these awards. However, you aren't getting the normal trickle of Phantasma from looting mobs or Soul Remnants from freeing Souls as you go in Jailer's Gauntlet, so are powers that trigger off Phantasma/Soul Remnants worth getting?

Surprisingly, the answer is often "yes". On a normal Torghast run, with no additional Anima powers to increase your take of Phantasma or Soul Remnants, you don't get a lot more than 200 Phantasma or 4 Soul Remnants per floor anyway -- and Jailer's Gauntlet has three more floors than normal Torghast. This means that if you get a power that multiples early, such as the Warrior Anima Power [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_pvp_softenedblows.gif) Неистощимая стойкость](https://ru.wowhead.com/spell=329207/%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%89%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%8F-%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B9%D0%BA%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D1%8C), which increases the duration of Die By The Sword, Enraged Regeneration, or Shield Wall by 20% per application of Soul Remnant's Blessing, you'll get crazy long durations of these abilities by the time you hit floor 8. Add in just a couple Anima powers to increase your Phantasma or Soul Remnants, and these powers that rely on getting more Phantasma/Soul Remnants can be truly amazing at the end.

One caveat to this is when gaining the Phantasma/Soul Remnants gives you a time-limited effect. For example, the Warlock ability [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_soulleech_3.gif) Тень в бутылке](https://ru.wowhead.com/spell=332775/%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%8C-%D0%B2-%D0%B1%D1%83%D1%82%D1%8B%D0%BB%D0%BA%D0%B5) increases your pets' damage by 200% for 30 seconds, which isn't long enough to be useful, particularly if you're shopping for new powers at the beginning of each level. With some levels, such as Floor 4, there is a long dogleg hall leading to the main room, and you will eat up at least 20 seconds of that time just getting to the initially spawned mobs. If you could manage to get a few stacks that would increase the time limit, that might make it useful, but I did 10 consecutive Jailer's Gauntlet runs on my Warlock and never had this power offered more than once.

Anima Powers in Jailer's Gauntlet
---------------------------------

In regular Torghast, you need to clear large amounts of trash packs and deal with big crowds. While you still have some mass-boss events in Jailer's Gauntlet, for the most part you're going to be concerned with dealing single target damage. For example, [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_idol_02.gif) Идол заблудших душ](https://ru.wowhead.com/spell=333024/%D0%B8%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BB-%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%B1%D0%BB%D1%83%D0%B4%D1%88%D0%B8%D1%85-%D0%B4%D1%83%D1%88) has the Warlock Venthyr ability [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_ardenweald_warlock.gif) Гниение души](https://ru.wowhead.com/spell=325640/%D0%B3%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5-%D0%B4%D1%83%D1%88%D0%B8) apply to 1 additional target. [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_ardenweald_warlock.gif) Гниение души](https://ru.wowhead.com/spell=325640/%D0%B3%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5-%D0%B4%D1%83%D1%88%D0%B8) normally hits up to 4 targets anyway, so this is not a terribly useful spell in Jailer's Gauntlet, where you will rarely have more than 4 mobs up at a time.

### Useless Powers in Jailer's Gauntlet

Some familiar Anima powers simply aren't that useful for Jailer's Gauntlet. There is a mix of powers that still show up that don't use mechanics present in Jailer's Gauntlet (hopefully these will be removed or hotfixed out), or don't make sense for this shorter, fast-paced game.

*   **Deadsoul Pool Removal**  
     [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_purify.gif) Пламя очистителя](https://ru.wowhead.com/spell=295754/%D0%BF%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%BC%D1%8F-%D0%BE%D1%87%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%8F) - Deadsoul Death Pools no longer damage you and heal you instead. While there are no Ravenous Anima Cells offered in Jailer's Gauntlet, this power does appear from time to time, especially when encountering bosses from Mort'regar. While this power is nearly indispensable in Mort'regar, where this can create huge areas of denial, this ability is so rarely encountered by very occasional trash packs and a few Gold Elites that it's not worth wasting Anima to get.
    

*   **Movement Speed Abilities**
    
    *    [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_rope_02.gif) Упряжь крысы Утробы](https://ru.wowhead.com/spell=295187/%D1%83%D0%BF%D1%80%D1%8F%D0%B6%D1%8C-%D0%BA%D1%80%D1%8B%D1%81%D1%8B-%D1%83%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%8B), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_mount_spectralhorse.gif) Призрачная уздечка](https://ru.wowhead.com/spell=315315/%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B7%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%87%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F-%D1%83%D0%B7%D0%B4%D0%B5%D1%87%D0%BA%D0%B0), and similar powers that give you a mount within Torghast are pretty much useless in Jailer's Gauntlet. These are one-room levels and there's no timer. Speed is not important here, and these require being out of combat to use.
        
    *    [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_hunter_pet_worm.gif) Пограничное состояние](https://ru.wowhead.com/spell=320800/%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B5-%D1%81%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%8F%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5) increases movement speed when you are near a wall or edge of a hallway. Speed increases are really of little use in Jailer's Gauntlet, and so many of the "rooms" are actually platforms with no edges that will trigger this ability anyway.
        
    

### Rethinking Anima Powers

Some Anima Powers are more useful in Jailer's Gauntlet than in regular Torghast. Some others require careful reading to understand how they work best. Some examples of Anima Powers that require rethinking:

*    [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_stone_weightstone_03.gif) Элетиевые грузила](https://ru.wowhead.com/spell=347968/%D1%8D%D0%BB%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5-%D0%B3%D1%80%D1%83%D0%B7%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%B0) - Your Strength, Agility, Stamina, and Intellect are increased by 30%, but you are no longer able to jump. Definitely worth taking in Jailer's Gauntlet, since you have almost no reason to jump here, except in rare occasions of getting feared off onto a lower ledge. There are usually other ways out of that predicament, though.
    
*    [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_knife_1h_draenorcrafted_d_01_b_alliance.gif) Нож с зазубринами](https://ru.wowhead.com/spell=322039/%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B6-%D1%81-%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%B7%D1%83%D0%B1%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B8) is a spell that requires understanding the somewhat vague language. This Anima Power states specifically that it does not work against bosses. This language is very important here -- in this case, the term "bosses" only applies to the level 62 gold elites -- the "end bosses" of the normal wings and Adamant Levels. It works fine against the level 60 gold elites and the level 61 Silver Rare elites.
    

### New Anima Powers in 9.2

There are some new Anima Powers introduced in 9.2 -- most are class-specific, and some are obviously created to replace similar powers that relied on breaking Ashen Phylacteries. These versions may only appear in Jailer's Gauntlet, as the abilities they are meant to replace seem to still be in the regular game. Both of these have original versions relying on breaking Ashen Phylacteries.

  

Basic Jailer's Gauntlet Tips
----------------------------

*   **Reconfigure your talents and build to emphasize single-target damage.** While you will occasionally be dealing with groups, these will mostly be non-elite mobs. Most of your battles will be against big mobs with lots of hit points and mitigation.
    
*   **Choose Anima Powers deliberately.** There's no timer, so no need to rush. Anima Powers earned from Anima Orbs have mostly been limited to things that will work with the differences of the Jailer's Gauntlet. However, some are definitely much better than others in practice.
    
*   **Brokers still offer some useless abilities for sale, so be careful**. My Warlock was offered [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_zulgurubtrinket.gif) Идол Хаоса](https://ru.wowhead.com/spell=322214/%D0%B8%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BB-%D1%85%D0%B0%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%B0) by a broker, and there are no Ashen Phylacteries in Jailer's Gauntlet. Don't just pick things you've used before in normal Torghast; make sure to understand how these will or won't work in the new format.
    
*   **Don't forget about crowd control.** The higher you go, the faster bosses will pop out of portals. You can crowd control them to keep them out of the way while you get the last one down.
    
*   **Don't leave a floor until you've double-checked for Anima Orbs.** Mobs can get scattered around on a floor, and Anima Orbs may drop in places you don't notice right away, particularly if you're playing a pet class or working in a group. Make sure to check each floor before you leave to make sure you didn't miss any.
