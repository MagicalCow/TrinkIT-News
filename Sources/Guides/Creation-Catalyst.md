On the latest Eternity's End 9.2 PTR build, the Creation Catalyst interface has been made available for testing, and we have a preliminary look on how to convert items into tier pieces! 

It is worth noticing that actually upgrading pieces is currently not testable. Below, we have all the currently known information on the Creation Catalyst.

## Creation Catalyst Location and Unlocking Requirements</h2>
The Creation Catalyst is located all the way south in Zereth Mortis, high up in the air within the Catalyst Gardens. You first come across the Creation Catalyst during [Chapter 4 of the 9.2 Campaign, Forging a New Path](https://www.wowhead.com/news/zereth-mortis-storyline-chapters-4-and-5-of-patch-9-2-questline-story-spoilers-325234). As this chapter is required to unlock the teleporter leading to the Sepulcher of the First ones raid, at least all raiders should have it completed by the time the Creation Catalyst is available for use.

It is worth reminding that the Creation Catalyst [will become available at Week 8 of Patch 9.2.](https://ptr.wowhead.com/news/blizzard-reveals-specific-details-on-tier-sets-in-patch-9-2-creation-catalyst-325798)

Currently, likely as a bug, flying is required to reach the Creation Catalyst, but General Draven is supposed to be able to fly to the console if you don't have flying unlocked.

## Catalyst Creation Interface</h2>

The Creation Catalyst interface is very simple - Simply input one item there, and a tier piece will be output. The Creation Catalyst also has a timer in case your cooldown is not charged, but there is currently no timer on when the cooldown is supposed to come up. Clicking the input window displays all items that are compatible with the catalyst.

As of the latest blue post on the subject, you will initially be able to convert one tier set piece per week, but the timer between conversions will shorten as the patch progresses.

Catalyst charges will start relatively rare (1/week) then accelerate in acquisition rate as the patch moves towards the future. These values will gradually accelerate over time, to the point where eventually you will be earning a charge every other day.</div></div>

If you mouseover the input window, you will see what pieces can be input there - Which can be any pieces from Shadowlands Season 3 Mythic+, Rated PvP or Sepulcher of the First Ones raid.

## Converting Items Into Tier Pieces</h2>
Converting a piece into raid gear is simple: Simply input a compatible piece into the input slot, and press Transform! Tier slots will be converted into tier set pieces. Pieces will be converted into tier of a similar item level of the piece put in, IE. Putting a ilvl 272 piece will convert the item into a 272 tier piece.

Non-tier set slots (Cloak, Bracers, Belt and Boots) can also be input into the Catalyst, and these will be turned into &quot;Tier&quot; pieces with different stats. These off-pieces will not count towards obtaining a set piece, but it can be a useful way to chase stats that might be better for your spec. As of note, this can be used to convert PvP pieces into tier pieces without the Versatility stat. 

It is currently unclear whether off-pieces created with the Creation Catalyst not giving tier set bonuses is intended or not.

PvP pieces transformed into tier pieces will retain the item level increase bonus from PvP pieces in PvP content like Battlegrounds, Arenas and War Mode.

When it comes to stats, Tier pieces have static secondary stats and any pieces converted will change secondary stats to match the tier that drops from the Sepulcher raid. However, if you convert a piece with a Tertiary stat such as Leech, Avoidance, Indestructible or a Socket, the converted piece will also contain that tertiary stat!

## Tier Item Conversion Costs</h2>
Here are the current costs for upgrading pieces into tier pieces. All prices below were tested with ilvl 272 PvP pieces, but we are reasonably sure the upgrade costs will stay the same regardless of whatever the item level of the piece converted is.

We have a preliminary post outlining all currently known sources of <a href="/currency=2009">Cosmic Flux</a>. You should be able to obtain close to 500 Cosmic Flux per day by doing normal activities in Zereth Mortis, with more Flux if you do more things like chase treasures and rares.
