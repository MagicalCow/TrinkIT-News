Last February, we highlighted Overwolf's decision to [deny WowUp API access to CurseForge](https://www.wowhead.com/news/ads-revenue-and-api-wowup-and-overwolf-split-over-addon-development-325912), citing their exclusivity clause and WowUp's decision to [partner with addon hosting competitor Wago.io](https://mailcoach.method.gg/webview/7e52f06b-1a71-4307-aef1-712b3a16a378). Although this change is taking some time to finalize, WowUp has released [a short guide to help its users prepare for the turnover](https://wowup.io/guide/wowup/curseforge-migration) \- attempting to find new hosts for addons that WowUp previously downloaded from CurseForge.

If you already use [CurseForge/Overwolf](https://www.wowhead.com/guides/best-addon-managers-wow-shadowlands#overwolf), or another way of installing your addons, this doesn't apply, but WowUp users will need to find new sources for some popular addons.

  
  
Following these steps as laid out by WowUp doesn't mean all addons will be found though. While many addons are also available for download on various other websites such as Github or WowInterface, others are _only_ found on CurseForge. For these, WowUp has a few suggestions:

You have several options none of them ideal.

*   Politely lobby the author of your missing addons to host them somewhere else, such as Wago or GitHub.
    
*   Lobby CurseForge to either give you a key for their new API or allow WowUp to host a solution that they agree to.
    
*   Use the CurseForge app.
    

Along with the fourth option of [manually update the remaining addons](https://www.wowhead.com/addons-how-to-install-and-maintain#installing), although that runs somewhat contrary to the point of using an addon manager in the first place. It's still not quite clear exactly when this changeover will happen, though keep in mind that this is about addon updating and management. Restricting CurseForge's API won't stop your already installed addons from working, they simply won't be updated by WowUp anymore - while that will certainly be a problem at _some_ point, you shouldn't have to worry about logging in one day in the near future and your addons suddenly not working.  
  

[Preparing for the WowUp/CurseForge Migration](https://wowup.io/guide/wowup/curseforge-migration)

  
  
If you're still unclear as to _why_ this is happening, we covered the subject extensively in our previous article on [ads, revenue, and API](https://www.wowhead.com/news/ads-revenue-and-api-wowup-and-overwolf-split-over-addon-development-325912), detailing how WowUp and other third party addon managers (many of which have since [begun shutting down](https://www.wowhead.com/news/the-end-of-ajour-overwolf-announces-new-api-roadmap-to-restrict-third-party-324892)) utilize the CurseForge repository without permission, financially penalizing both Overwolf and the addon developers paid by CurseForge downloads.

CurseForge does not have an official API for 3rd parties who want to download files from its servers. The way some addon managers operate today, is by reverse engineering the calls between the Twitch Client and the CurseForge backend. A good analogy is someone reverse engineering the Spotify app to stream songs from Spotify’s servers without receiving Spotify’s or the artists’ consent to do so.  
Unauthorized use of the CurseForge API introduces challenges that need solving. Most notably:

*   Authors did not give their consent to have their creations distributed outside CurseForge
    
*   Authors’ earnings will be impacted, as CurseForge has no way of monitoring engagement outside its own ecosystem, and changes are coming to the rewards program
    
*   Downloads originated from 3rd party services rely on CurseForge servers and CDN, incurring substantial costs and offering nothing to cover them
