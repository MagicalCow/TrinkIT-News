С выходом Леща [26го сентября](https://t.me/trink_it_now/7335), игра получит множество изменений, мы подготовили обзор самых важных из них.



With [Wrath of the Lich King Classic releasing on September 26th](https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/news/wrath-of-the-lich-king-classic-arrives-september-26-327972), Classic players will notice many changes on items going from Burning Crusade to the Pre-Patch. We have compiled a list of the most notable item stat changes and updated our item database filters for our [Wrath Classic site](https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk)

## Отхил и урон спеллов → Си

 _[![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_mace_72.gif) Молот посвящения](https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/ru/item=34335/молот-посвящения) in Burning Crusade Classic and Wrath Classic_

One of the most notable changes in Wrath of the Lich King Classic is how Spell Healing and Spell Damage is being bundled into an entirely new stat, "Spell Power" which will apply to Damaging spells and Healing spells. This is a significant change for hybrid classes and will make swapping specs much easier, as the gear will still be useful. Examples of this include Balance Druids/Restoration Druids, Elemental Shamans/Restoration Shamans, and Shadow Priests/Holy Priests.  

With the addition of Dual Talent Specialization and Spell Power on gear, it will make the process much easier for players interested in forming 10-man raid groups on the fly with a good raid composition in Wrath Classic.  

While Spell Power applies to gear and some buffs in the game, such as [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_totemofwrath.gif) Тотем гнева](https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/ru/spell=57722/тотем-гнева) (Increasing damage and healing of raid members), "Healing done by spells" is still on your character sheet. This is notable from healing talents such as [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_natureblessing.gif) Благословение природы](https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/ru/spell=30869/благословение-природы) for Resto Shamans, which will only increase Healing done and have no effect on spell damage.

### Spell Hit Rating → Hit Rating  
Spell Haste Rating → Haste Rating  
Spell Critical Strike Rating → Critical Strike Rating

 _[![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_gauntlets_15.gif) Боевые рукавицы оскверненных миров](https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/ru/item=34344/боевые-рукавицы-оскверненных-миров) in Burning Crusade Classic and Wrath Classic_

Another notable stat change is how Hit Rating and Haste Rating will apply to both melee and spellcasters. This is particularly important for the new hero class, [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_deathknight.gif) Рыцарь смерти](https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/ru/death-knight), which has both melee attacks and spells. If this change wasn't made, it would be very difficult for a Death Knight to acquire enough melee hit from gear and spell hit!  

While Hit Rating, Haste Rating, and Crit Rating from gear does apply to both spellcasters and melee, all the previous stats are still present on the character sheet. This is important because many buffs and debuffs in the game only apply to melee or spellcasters, respectively. For example, [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_windfury.gif) Тотем неистовства ветра](https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/ru/spell=8512/тотем-неистовства-ветра) only benefits melee haste, [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_faeriefire.gif) Улучшенный волшебный огонь](https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/ru/spell=33602/улучшенный-волшебный-огонь) only benefits spell hit, and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_unyeildingstamina.gif) Вожак стаи](https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/ru/spell=24932/вожак-стаи) only benefits physical crit.

### Attacks Ignore Armor → Armor Penetration Rating

[![](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/1072840.png)](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/1072840.png)
  
 _[![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_helmet128.gif) Капюшон Аллерии](https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/ru/item=34333/капюшон-аллерии) in Burning Crusade Classic and Wrath Classic_

Similar to how Critical Strike _Rating_ became a thing when Burning Crusade released, Armor Penetration sees a similar update in Wrath of the Lich King. The new Rating system will be a scaling system where instead of a piece of gear reducing the target's armor by a flat amount, it will now be percentage based, changing as your character levels.  

For example, at Level 70 you will need 5.92 Armor Penetration Rating to ignore 1% of the target's armor. By Level 80 this number jumps up to 13.99 Armor Penetration Rating. This same Percentage of armor ignored system will even apply to armor debuffs in raids, so both [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_warrior_riposte.gif) Ослабление доспеха](https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/ru/spell=8647/ослабление-доспеха) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_warrior_sunder.gif) Раскол брони](https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/ru/spell=7386/раскол-брони) will ignore 20% of the target's armor, assuming there are 5 stacks of sunder. _Sunder, please!_

### Feral Attack Power

 _[![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_weapon_shortblade_75.gif) Крест Апокалипсиса](https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/ru/item=34329/крест-апокалипсиса) in Burning Crusade Classic and Wrath Classic_

Most players are already used to seeing Feral Attack Power on items, such as [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_staff_12.gif) Посох первобытных инстинктов](https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/ru/item=34198/посох-первобытных-инстинктов) from Sunwell Plateau. Going into Wrath of the Lich King Classic, [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_druid.gif) Друид](https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/ru/druid) players will start to notice "Feral Attack Power" on any item that can be equipped. **Only [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_druid.gif) Друид](https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/ru/druid)s will see this stat on the item's in-game tooltips.**

_Item Filters for new Stats on Wowhead_

With all the stat changes being introduced in Wrath Classic, we have updated our item database filters to help users find new item upgrades and compare items easier. In addition to the above stats, we have also included [Bonus Armor as an item filter](https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/items?filter=109;1;0), which will list items that have additional Armor added in their stat budget, such as [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_pants_plate_32.gif) Столпы мощи](https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/ru/item=49904/столпы-мощи) or [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_cape_naxxramas_03.gif) Плащ затемненного солнца](https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/ru/item=40252/плащ-затемненного-солнца).
